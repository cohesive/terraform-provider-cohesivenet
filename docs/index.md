# Cohesivenet Provider

Use the Cohesive Networks provider to deploy, license and configure one or many VNS3 Controllers.



## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    cohesivenet = {
      source = "cohesive/cohesivenet"
      version = "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}


# Configure Cohesive Terraform Provider Specify host and either api_token or username/password

provider "cohesivenet" {
  username = var.username
  host = aws_eip.vns3_ip_1.public_ip
  password = aws_instance.vns3controller_1.id
  //token = cohesivenet_vns3_config.vns3_1.token
}
```


## Authentication

The Cohesive provider offers various means of providing credentials for authentication. The following methods are supported:

* Static credentials
* Environment variables

### Static credentials
!> **WARNING:** Hard-coding credentials into any Terraform configuration is not recommended, and risks secret leakage should this file be committed to public version control

Static credentials can be provided by specifying the `controller_ip`, `username` and `password` arguments in-line in the cohesivenet provider block:


### Environment variables
You can provide credentials via the `CN_HOST`, `CN_USERNAME`, `CN_PASSWORD` environment variables, representing your Aviatrix controller's public IP, username and password of your Aviatrix access account, respectively.

```hcl
provider "cohesivenet" {}
```

**Usage:**

```sh
$ export CN_HOST = "1.2.3.4"
$ export CN_USERNAME = "admin"
$ export CN_PASSWORD = "password"
$ terraform plan
```
